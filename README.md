<h1>8085 Microprocessor Kit Simulator</h1>
<strong>Hello Folks</strong>,

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the 8085 Microprocessor Kit Simulator! This project simulates the functionality of an 8085 microprocessor kit, providing a virtual environment to learn and experiment with microprocessor operations.</p>
<span style="background: yellow; color: red">NOTE: THIS VERSION DOES NOT INCLUDE ERROR TESTING SO WRITE EVERYTHING CAREFULLY WHILE ENTERING COMMANDS.</span>

<h2>HOW TO USE Simulator:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In PC, it directly takes commands from the keyboard.</li>
  <li>In Mobile Phone, you can see an option on the left saying "Activate mobile keyboard," you can click on it to activate your mobile keyboard and start entering the commands.</li>
  <li>
    <h3><strong>Commands</strong></h3>
    <p>Note - all commands are case insensitive, you can enter in any command case. While Seeing the "Student-85" screen the following commands will work:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Assembly code</strong> - Type '1' and then 'a' to enter assembly code. After entering, it asks for a RAM address to start entering code. After entering the address, press enter and start writing your assembly code.</li>
      <li><strong>Data at RAM address</strong> - Type 'M' to enter data at the RAM address, enter the address of the memory location, and then hit enter.</li>
      <li><strong>Program Address to Execute</strong> - Type 'G' to enter the program address for execution, enter your program address, and then press '$' (use shift + 4 for '$').</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The blue range input is for resizing the microprocessor kit.</li>
  <li>You can choose the screen color with radio buttons.</li>
  <li>On the right of the screen, there is a sliding power switch for the Microprocessor kit. The red LED below indicates power on/off.</li>
</ul>
